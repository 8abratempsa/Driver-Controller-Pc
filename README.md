# Driver Controller Pc
  
So, I had to install a new Power Supply for my PC a couple days ago because my PC wouldn't start. After I had life again and thought all was good, I immediately noticed I was unable to connect to my wired internet.
 
I went to device manager and noticed my ethernet device wasn't even listed under network adapters but now under other devices as "ethernet controller". When I clicked on it, I was met with the following device status: -The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28) -There are no compatible drivers for this device. -To find a driver for this device, click Update Driver.

I tried troubleshooting multiple times through windows but when I followed their steps and restarted my PC, still nothing changed. Then, I went to Intel forums, videos, and websites supporting my issue and went through various guided steps to try and solve this.
 
After installing the latest version of Intel Ethernet Adapter Complete Driver Pack and many hoops and bounds later, I went back into device manager and noticed my ethernet device was now showing under network adapters as "Intel(R) Ethernet Controller (2) I225-V".
 
In device manager, I attempted to automatically install the driver through windows and it would not work being unable to find a compatible driver. I also tried manually installing it and choosing a driver and was still unsuccessful.
 
After enabling/disabling my ethernet device, trying the steps over and over again, trying to install an older version of the driver, updating my BIOS, made sure my ethernet cables were stable and good, and going down tons of rabbit holes, I end up where I started with the same device statuses.
 
2. I don't know what caused my last power supply unit to fail. I was able to power on and operate my PC the night before like any typical night, but the next day it wouldn't power on at all after trying a different power cord, outlet, etc.

When I go into device manager and attempt updating the driver with the file I extracted from the Intel Ethernet Adapter Complete Driver Pack zip file I downloaded, I am met with this screen (image applies to both searching automatically for drivers, and browsing my PC files for driver.
 
I also made the discovery that when I click on "Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer", and choose any of the listed Intel driver devices to try and install, I am met with the same (Code 10) this device cannot start. Additionally, now my device name of "ethernet controller" moves from the other devices tab to under the network adapter tab and matches the name of the driver device tried installing prior as you can see in this image:
 
So I went to your link and downloaded and extracted the zip file of "Intel Network Drivers" version 26.2.0.1 under the subcategory "LAN Drivers". I auto ran the app and attempted to install it was met with this screen:
 
Since you are using MSI product, with embedded NIC, contact MSI support for further assistance. They may be able to provide additional troubleshooting steps or even replace the motherboard if it is found to be defective.

Windows 10 has a native driver system embedded in the OS. By keeping your device up-to-date, you will ensure that you are always running the latest software or hardware drivers, as Microsoft frequently fixes known issues. View instructions to check for the latest updates for your Windows 10-based device.
 
**Note #1:** Make sure to check you have all the Windows updates before doing the driver installation. Also, make sure to do this step disconnected from the internet (wi-fi or wired connection) since Microsoft updates drivers automatically and prevents doing the clean installation successfully.
 
**Note #2:** Since this is a laptop, we recommend checking with your System Manufacturer and using the driver software provided by them to avoid potential installation incompatibilities. Intel supplies generic versions of Graphics Drivers for general purposes. Computer manufacturers might have changed the features, incorporated customizations, or made other changes to the graphics driver software or software packaging.
 
Hello there! Thank you for your reply.

I want to say that I just reinstalled windows and thats why I might have a old verison.
I will try to download your first option of latest intel.

But if that doesn't work which of this drives I should get from System Manufacturer? ( VGA Driver - Intel or VGA Driver (GeForce GTX 1650). And also which VGA Utility should I go ? From Intel or from NVIDIA?
 

**#SUPPLIMENTARY:** When my GPU 1 (GeForce GTX 1650) goes down it usually does with a blue screen, then laptop restart and GPU 1 is not activated. Then at a random time I get Blue screen from nowhere and when laptop restart I get GPU 1 activated. The problem had advanced since begging. In begging it would went OFF only when playing games ( LOL / CS ). In last 3 months it goes OFF randomly when I play youtube or coding (Visual Studio Code). If the problem will not be occured with having the drives you recommend then it is a GPU 1 problem and I need it in service?

**#ADDITIONALLY:** When GPU 1 is down I also can't use HDMI ( I usually stay on laptop + another screen ).
 
I can help you with troubleshooting the iGPU (Intel UHD Graphics for 10th Gen Intel Processors), however, since you have problems while using the NVIDIA graphics and that Intel controller is not related to the iGPU, you need to contact your System Manufacturer as it would be out of our scope.
 
Since you have problems using the NVIDIA graphics (Discrete Graphics card) and the Intel controller you are referring to is not related to the iGPU, you need to contact your System Manufacturer, 3rd party products like NVIDIA and other motherboard controllers are out of our scope.
 
I just did a fresh OS install Windows 10 Pro x64 on a new SSD Samsung 850PRO and the **SAS Controller driver is missing** (from what Device Manager is showing). I can't seem to find it anywhere, all the other drivers were installed via a 3rd party auto driver detect/install software because I couldn't use the HP platform to find the original ones (all I can find are the drivers for the current Z420)

Please help, I m not sure if this is also linked to the fact that my SSD is telling me AHCI mode is deactivated (in BIOS the AHCI+RAID is active.
 
This package contains the Intel Rapid Storage Technology Enterprise (RSTe) Drivers and Graphical User Interface (GUI) for serial ATA (SATA) RAID controllers in supported workstation models that are running a supported Microsoft Windows Operating System.
 
See the **VCM-D1 User Manual** for additional information regarding this device. VCM-D1 drivers built prior to August 2009 are not compatible with the 710A cable, contact us for further details.
 
Simple and straightforward controls allow the VCM-D1 to be easy to use and configure. (See VCM-D1 user manual, starting on page 16.) LED indicators reveal shutter status at a glance, while the MODE key switch (2) will set the unit to a specific interrupt mode not allowing an inadvertent change in setting once the key is removed. Additional interrupt functions are available at the MODE CONTROL 7-PIN pluggable connector (1). The AUX output and +5VDC output are also available at the MODE CONTROL (1) terminal block.
 
All main input/output functions can be accessed at the VCM-D1 rear panel (see VCM-D1 user manual page 21), including the 115/230VAC input (8) which is manually selectable. (See page 49 for fuse specifications and page #12 for fuse replacement instructions.) BNC connectors allow for quick termination of TTL command signals. Function switches A-F (9) determine the active state of the BNC inputs or outputs (high or low level active). Function switch H (9) selects HIGH/LOW energy level. Function switch G (9) will disable the SYNC output BNC (10) and disable the IR emitter of the synchronization circuit within the shutter used. See page #49 of the user manual for FUNCTION switch settings.
 
Greetings! As I recently mentioned in another thread, I've been working on a driver for the new Zooz ZEN32 scene controller device to expose all button taps (Hubitat's maxes out at double taps, as usual) while otherwise being as Hubitat-like as possible in implementation. Code link is below, or use the raw URL, -zen32-scene-ctlr.groovy, to import directly:
 
This driver exposes most device parameters in some way. Some LED parameters are not exposed as preferences because they can instead be handled with the setLED() command. For example, with buttons/LEDs 1-4, a setLED() command with a level of 0 will set that LED to off (or "always off" per the documentation description). This is different from the Hubitat driver, where this is a preference only, so the LEDs can now be turned on and off by commands--and apps--and not just manually via preferences. (Actually, looks like Hubitat's can do that now, so either I mis-remembered or it was added.) Using the setLED() command with a non-zero level (and color) will also keep the LED always on. I think the Zooz docs mean that options besides "always on" or "always off" for these LEDs sync the state with that of an associated device, but I do not use Z-Wave Association or have any way to configure that in this driver, nor is it my intent to use the device for this purpose (I was aiming for hub-controlled LED indicators you can use to show whatever status you want and scene/button events you can use for any purpose).
